AlphaOfTech is an automated tech intelligence service. Every day, our pipeline analyzes 800+ stories, 7,000+ developer discussions, and 150+ research papers — then distills them into one actionable briefing.

Every week, we go further: identify the biggest developer pain points from real community discussions, then design and ship a production-ready open-source tool that solves it.

**What we cover:** AI, infrastructure, security, open source, SaaS, developer tools, and emerging research.

**How it works:** Data collection from global tech communities and academic repositories, followed by multi-layered AI analysis — trend detection, sentiment analysis, keyword extraction, and research synthesis.
