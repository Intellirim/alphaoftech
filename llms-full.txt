# AlphaOfTech - Full Documentation for LLMs

## Overview
AlphaOfTech is a fully automated tech intelligence platform. Every day at 09:00 KST (00:00 UTC), it crawls global developer communities, analyzes trends using AI, and publishes actionable intelligence across 5 channels.

## Daily Pipeline
1. Crawl 300+ Hacker News stories with comments
2. Crawl latest ArXiv papers (AI, ML, Security, Systems)
3. Crawl Techmeme headlines for mainstream tech trends
4. GPT-4o-mini analyzes data across 5 dimensions: trends, keywords, sentiment, community, research
5. Generate reports in Korean (Telegram) and English (Blog, Bluesky, Dev.to)
6. Auto-submit to search engines via IndexNow

## Weekly AutoSolve Pipeline
Every Monday at 11:00 KST:
1. Extract top developer pain points from the week
2. Claude designs a solution
3. Claude builds a complete open-source tool
4. Publish to GitHub and PyPI
5. Promote across all channels
