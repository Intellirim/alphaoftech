## What is AlphaOfTech?

AlphaOfTech is an AI-powered intelligence platform that helps developers and founders stay ahead of the curve.

### Daily Tech Intelligence

Every day, our automated pipeline:
- Crawls **800+ tech stories** and **7,000+ developer discussions** from global communities
- Analyzes **150+ latest research papers** across AI, ML, Security, and Systems
- Extracts key signals, emerging trends, and market opportunities
- Delivers concise, actionable intelligence briefings

### Weekly Open-Source Tools

Every week, we go one step further:
- Identify the **biggest developer pain points** from real community discussions
- Design and build a **production-ready open-source tool** that solves it
- Publish it on GitHub for anyone to use

This is not vaporware — each tool is auto-generated, validated, and shipped with working code.

### The Growth Loop

**Read insights → Discover tools → Build faster → Come back for more.**

We believe the best way to grow is to consistently deliver real value — both knowledge and code.
